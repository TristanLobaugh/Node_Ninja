# ssh into your server (as deploy user) and install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install 6

# IMPORTANT!
# .bashrc will prevent nvm from running over ssh, we need to move nvmrc up to the top

# install pm2
npm i -g pm2
# tell pm2 to startup on machine boot
pm2 startup ubuntu
# get the path for this version of pm2 - we'll use this for deployment,
# otherwise deployment will break when we change a version
which pm2


# back on your machine install pm2 to your repo
npm i -D pm2
#add a .nvmrc file if it doesn't exist

# create an ecosystem file
pm2 ecosystem

# change ecosystem.json values for your project
# IMPORTANT! use the FULL path of pm2 - the one you got from "which pm2 on your server"
pm2 deploy production setup
pm2 deploy production

# make a change and redeploy

# now we can monitor our app
ssh deploy@<ip address> pm2 monit
